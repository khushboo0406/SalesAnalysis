🚀 Power BI Dashboard - Transforming Business Data into Actionable Insights

🔍 Project Overview: I recently completed a Power BI dashboard project where I focused on transforming raw business data into insightful, actionable visualizations. This was a guided project where I not only created the dashboard but also followed a structured approach involving business requirements, user stories, and data transformation.

📄 Business Requirements Document (BRD): To kickstart the project, I created a Business Requirements Document (BRD) to clearly outline the business goals and objectives. The BRD helped in aligning the dashboard development process with the stakeholders’ expectations and ensured that the final product met the business needs.

📚 User Stories Document: To ensure the dashboard would meet the specific needs of its users, I created User Stories that outlined what different stakeholders (e.g., sales managers, data analysts, etc.) would need from the dashboard. These user stories guided the design and layout of the visuals.

Business Request & User Stories: The business request for this data analyst project which is an executive sales report for sales managers. Based on the request made from the business person , user stories were defined to fulfill delivery and ensure that acceptance criteria's were maintained throughout the project.

Data Cleaning and Transformation (SQL): To create the necessary data model for doing analysis and fulfilling the business needs defined in the user stories the tables were extracted using SQL. One data source (sales budget) was provided in excel format and was connected in the data model in a later step of the process.

Sales Management Dashboard: The Finished Sales Management Dashboard which consist one page works as a dashboard and overview while two other pages focuses on combining tables for necessary details and visualizations to show sales over time per customers and per products.

✨ Key Takeaways:
·      Successfully translated business requirements into a functional Power BI dashboard.
·      Applied data transformation techniques and advanced DAX functions to provide insightful metrics.
·      Developed a user-centric dashboard that enables easy exploration and decision-making.
